For the story, 
our game will be 
in a world ravaged by civil war.  
The two sides, 
the righteous Imperial Authority 
and the rebellious Freeman’s Syndicate, 
have been at war for nearly two decades 
trying to regain control and peace 
in the The Grand Kingdom.  
The main protagonist, 
a rookie warrior in the Imperial Authority, 
must go on a daring and dangerous mission 
to save his high ranking father 
after he is captured by the enemy during battle 
and the other officers 
deem a rescue mission too risky.  
With nothing but his basic training and bravery, 
the player will meet interesting people, 
face challenging enemies, 
and learn of a secret plan 
that would end the war once and for all 
while trying to rescue his father.
